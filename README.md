weather-app
===========

This is a weather forecast app I created. You can enter a city and state and get back a 5 day forecast.

It uses AngularJS, Angular-UI Bootstrap, Twitter Bootstrap 3, bower, jQuery, Font Awesome, and Weather Icons. It also makes use of ngAnimate.

To run the app, you must have node installed on your machine. Then clone the repo to your machine.

Steps to run:
```bash 
cd weather-app
```
```bash
node server.js
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/index.html#/`

Enter city,state in the box, press enter, and enjoy the forecasts!
